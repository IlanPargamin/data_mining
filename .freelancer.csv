Build a new CMMS platform with an IOS and Android App,6 days left,https://www.freelancer.com/projects/android/build-new-cmms-platform-with/,"Hello Freelancers, 

For a new project, we are in need for a developer or a team developers that can create a new CMMS system.

This system should be able to do the following: 
- Create workorders 
- Create preventive inspections for real estate property
- Order cleaning
- Order maintenance i.e. Pool cleaning 

The platform will be used by people who have a holiday house (second house) in example in Spain or in Croatia. They want to monitor the house with the app. Meaning that they will have access (via APP) to check when was the latest cleaning, when was the last maintenance of the pool and so on. 

Furthermore the app should have an AFTERCARE factor. Meaning that if the temporary resident (that has an property in country XYZ), comes and needs some additional services like ""dinner for 2"" or ""pay my bills online"" and so on, they will be able to do that with the app. 

At the last the app should have an FUN factor, where the temporary resident, but not only this group of people, can for example order an ""Bird seeing"" or ""rent a car"" through the app. 

All the functionalities should be build dynamic, so that we can add additional services in the platform and the app should be build for IOS and Android. 

We will need the whole package; design, development, project management and Q&A!

I need an essay writing agency,6 days left,https://www.freelancer.com/projects/research-writing/need-essay-writing-agency/,"Dear contact, 
I own a successful essay writing service and currently looking to expand it. I have my own writers and everything is operating smoothly; however, I was thinking that I will avoid all the headache with contacting the writers and having to make sure everything is done on time without plagiarism if I can hire an agency to do the whole process for me. I am looking for an agency with well trained professional writers that will finish the tasks with great quality and good prices. Since India is a country with an extremely low income per person compared to other countries across the world, I figured you may be a right fit for my business. If the tasks are done with god quality, on time, and good prices, we can significantly grow our number of clients which will definitely result in the growth of both businesses together. We currently pay around 7USD per 500 words to each writer that we operate with. If you can offer me 8USD/500 words, I will be able to expand both businesses with extremely fast pace as I will be able to grow the client base with my current great prices and decrease all the headache that comes from the writers' side which will make me focus more and more on the client experience and make sure that each of them is not a one time client. From my side, I wish I made everything clear and if you have anymore questions, please do not hesitate to ask. I would like to receive some kind of assurance that all the tasks will be done with great quality and on time. I will not ask for a specific way here as you are the ones that own the agency and know how to brand yourself to clients.
