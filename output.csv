Small PHP Project,6,https://www.freelancer.com/projects/php/small-php-project-33164212/,"I need this following functionality for a client. I will do the CSS I need only the PHP, HTML and SQL part.

[login to view URL] a MySQL table High scores in database M133 for high score list. The following columns are to be provided: ID, creation time stamp, alias, seconds, tip number. Find meaningful default values and forbid empty or meaningless entries. Optimize the table to handle large numbers of entries. Keyword-like description of the program flow as a website:

2. First visit: Welcome to the game, invitation to play with a clear explanation of what is involved, display of the top ten of the current high score list, input option for the alias, start button to start the game. The high score list shows: rank, alias, time in seconds, number of tips needed.
2.1 If you have played before, the alias is already entered as a default in the input field.

3. After pressing the start button: A stopwatch starts running internally. The website asks, ""What's your 1st tip?"" After entering a tip, the next page with the answer is displayed. From the 2nd tip, the time required so far is also displayed in seconds. It is always possible to abandon the game and return to 2.
4. The answer repeats the tip and only writes ""Hit!"", ""Bigger"", ""Smaller"".
4.1 For ""larger"" and ""smaller"" it is displayed ""what is your x. Tip?"". If there are more than 15 tips without a hit, the program no longer displays an input field, but instead explains that the hit should have been found long ago and displays the number you are looking for and the number of seconds that have elapsed so far. The limit of 15 should be easily changeable.
4.2 In the case of a hit, a congratulation, the number of tips and the number of seconds required for this will be displayed. The run is saved in the database. If your result is in the top 5, the top 5 list is displayed with your result highlighted. If you have reached the same time as an existing entry in the list, the program ranks the new time before the existing one. The number of top x displays should be easily changeable.
5. If ""Hit"" was achieved or too many hints were needed, the program will ask if you want to play again. If yes, continue with 3, if no with 2.

6. Operate the game with any desired from-to values, for example 100 to 900. Of course, the game explanations and end/cancel conditions must then also be adjusted

7. In point 4.1, variable instead of fixed limit: Calculation of the minimum number of bets required, calculation of the limit as (minimum + 50%). If 6 was realized, considering the range of values played.

8. At 4.2 it is still displayed whether it was the minimum number of bets. Was it less, output that you were lucky, got ... were it more, display ""You needed x tips more than the minimum necessary y."", where x and y are of course to be calculated. If 6 was realized, considering the range of values played.

9. If point 7 is realized, adjustments to the high score table to record the number range of the game. The high score table should only list those in the score display that were entered for the same number range just played.

10. Adjustment to be able to set the weather report of the game yourself at every game start

11. Adaptation of the high-score list display: For each entry, the number of tips below or above optimum should be displayed in a new column Deviation at the back, i.e. -2, 0 or +4, with visible signs. If 6 was realized, considering the range of values played.

 12. AJAX version of the game. The page does not reload after program start, communication with the server is based on AJAX only.

This project will involve designing and implementing an agent for solving the travelling salesman problem.,6,https://www.freelancer.com/projects/python/this-project-will-involve-designing/,"1st task:
The first step would be to use the GA on its own with a default set of parameters and obtain a baseline tour cost from a given node in the [login to view URL] GA would need to be programmed in Python given the algorithm outlined in the class and additional information on selection and crossover operators available from document.
> Produce Python code in .ipynb form to implement the GA as described in the slides and additional information document. 
> Produce the chromosome with the lowest fitness value from the modified population. Add on the starting node value at the beginning and at the end to form a cycle. Now work out its cost by traversing the path in the cycle. Report on this value as baseline1.

2nd Task:
The next step would be to run the SA in networkx using the same network configuration that was used for the GA. Use all default parameter settings recommended by networkx. 
Produce the Python code for this task
Obtain the tour cost and report this as baseline2. 
3rd task:
The final step in the project is to take SA’s parameter set (PS) and pass it through the GA for optimization. Once the parameter set PS has been optimized, it is passed over to SA and a tour and its cost are obtained from the tuned version of SA. The expectation is that the tuned version will have lower tour costs than the baseline1 and baseline2 values that were recorded earlier for GA and SA respectively. There are many SA parameters that can be optimized. For the purpose of this project, we will solely focus on alpha. Look up the networkx documentation on background for its parameters.
Write a Python script for generating alpha values in the range of .01 to 1.0 in steps of .001.
Pass this as a population to your GA and perform the same steps as in Task 1. For each value of alpha in the range [.01, 1.0], produce a tour. Obtain the set of tours T that covers the alpha range and use this set as your population. Now perform crossover and mutation on T in exactly the same way that you did in

I mounted a magnet on this engraver. I can get the engraver to work and move the carriage with the software that came with the laser engraver.

I would also like to control the colors of a WS1812b addressable led strip depending on the position of the ball.
